## 2\. Enhance Communication and Connection

Effective communication and fostering connection among team members can significantly contribute to resilience and stress management. Consider the following strategies:

- Regular check-ins: Maintain consistent communication channels, such as daily or weekly check-ins, to provide opportunities for team members to express their concerns, share progress, and offer support.
